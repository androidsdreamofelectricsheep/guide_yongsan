## Public Data Portal

GuideYongsan utilizes a given api from Public Data Portal [Yongsan-gu, Seoul_Convenience facilities/company inquiry service for foreigners](https://www.data.go.kr/en/data/15097096/openapi.do#/tab_layer_prcuse_exam).

More detail and usage guide, see [OGD Reuse Guides](https://www.data.go.kr/en/ugs/selectPublicDataUseGuideView.do#publicData_summary_03).

## Naver Map

GuideYongsan also uses [Naver Cloud Platform](https://www.ncloud.com/product/applicationService/maps). In order for it to work, you need to obtain your API key. After you create the key, you will also need to enable API for each platform. To enable Naver Map for Android, provide Android app package name e.g. "com.example.your_app". For iOS provide iOS Bundle ID e.g. "com.example.yourApp"

For more details, see [Prerequisites for using Maps](https://guide.ncloud-docs.com/docs/maps-spec).

If files contain Google Maps API are added to .gitignore, so your key will not be accidentally committed. Make sure you don't put your API keys anywhere else before pushing your work.

> üí° _This README is a work-in-progress and will be soon updated with all necessary information about the application architecture, ways to build the project, and ways to contribute to this project._
